# Merge

Merge is a command that allows you to combine changes from different branches. It is used to integrate changes from one branch into another. The branch that is being merged into is called the **receiving branch**. The branch that is being merged from is called the **source branch**.

```bash
# Merge the source branch into the receiving branch (current branch)
git merge source-branch
```
