# Pull Requests

A pull request is a way to ask someone to review changes you've made to a repository. It's a way to contribute to a project without having write access to the repository. 

It's used in a team based workflow where you want to get feedback on your changes before merging them into the main branch.

Commonly, within a team, a developer will create a new branch, make changes, push the branch to the remote repository, and then create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.
